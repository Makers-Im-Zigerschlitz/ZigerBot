ZigerBot

Arduino shield to teach STEM / basic robotics

Current state: planning

Goal

Create an Arduino(R) shield to help teach STEM / basic robotics

General idea

We love teaching about mechanics, electricity, electronics and robotics. ZigerBot allows us to have a robust platform to teach the very basic of all this. Participants build their own robotic platform, solder the ZigerBot shield and connect both. ZigerBot can then be programmed via Arduino IDE or ArduBlockly .
