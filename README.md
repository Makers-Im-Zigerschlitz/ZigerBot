# ZigerBot
Arduino shield to teach STEM / basic robotics

Current state: **planning**

## Goal
Create an arduino uno shield to help teach STEM / basic robotics

## General idea
We love teaching about mechanics, electricity, electronics and robotics. ZigerBot allows us to have a robust platform to teach the very basic of all this. Participants build their own robotic platform, solder the ZigerBot shield and connect both. ZigerBot can then be programmed via [Arduino IDE](www.arduino.cc) or [Blockly@rduino](http://technologiescollege.github.io/Blockly-at-rduino/index.html).

## Features for first iteration
- Power-Input: Drives ZigerBot and powers Arduino
- Drives two DC motors, connect with screw terminals
- Has an RGB LED matrix (5x5 or bigger)
- Can play simple melodies or signal tones 
- Has tactile button inputs
- Has 1-2 potentiometers
- Power-LED and Reset-Button
